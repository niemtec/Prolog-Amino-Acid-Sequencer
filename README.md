# Amino Acid DNA Sequencer
An amino acid sequencer written in PROLOG as part of 2015 Logic and Computation Course at Brunel University London.

This project involves the analysis of protein sequences, DNA sequences and amino acids.

## Functions
This solution performs the following functions:
* Determines if a particular symbol coresponds to an amino acid or not.
* When given a short name of an amino acid, it displays the long name.
* Displays the long name of all of the small neutral amino acids.
* Displays all of the aromatic and not positively charged amino acids.
* For any given three DNA molecules, it displays the amino acid.
* For a list of amino acids, it displays each amino acid's property in a report format.
* For a given potein sequence in a list, the program displays all possible DNA sequences for all of the amino acids that have more than one set of DNA sequences.
* It produces a report for each possible sequence and counts how many times each of the four molecules occur.
